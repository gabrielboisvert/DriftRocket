# Full support of ps4 and ps5 controller
- Gyroscope
- Acceleration
- Touch Pad
- Microphone

# Challenge
In order to make the gyroscope and touch pad usable in unity, I had to override the basic input system of unity and create my own interface.
Based on a shema explaning the bit order and size of each button, I successfully extract the data from the controller.
